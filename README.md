# LiveTranslate
Surviving when we travel to a new place is becoming quite hard without understanding what others speak and it becomes critical when old aged (even middle-aged) people travel and it becomes a major reason why they donâ€™t prefer to travel although they wanted to. So my idea is to make an app that uses ML Kit, AutoML Translation and AutoML Natural Language to translate the other's speech tell them what others say lively and helps them to have the actual conversation via this app. This can be done both by inputting both audio and video. Another feature is the live translation of chat where people will type in their own language, which will be translated simultaneously as they type and sent to the other person.
