# LiveTranslate
When people want to go to new places where the native language is different from theirs, it becomes extremely difficult, especially for old-aged people(or even middle-aged people). This is the main reason why people don't prefer traveling to places with different languages although they have a strong desire to travel.

So my idea is to build an app ( called Live Translate ) that uses ML Kit, AutoML Translation and AutoML Natural Language to translate the others' speech and tell them what others say spontaneously and help them to have an actual conversation via this app. This can be done both by inputting the audio and video. Another feature of this app is the live translation of chat where the user will be able to type or speak in their own language, which will be translated simultaneously as they type or speak and sent to the other person. This helps in various scenarios, one is while chatting with others and another situation where a physically challenged person, who couldn't speak but could perform other activities normally, is trying to have a conversation and for blind people, in the tourism department, in situations wherein a blind person could be kept at the tourist spots and tourists could have effective communication with them via the app to answer their queries. This will be of great help to these type of people as this app facilitates to have an effective conversation and thereby making them more employable.
